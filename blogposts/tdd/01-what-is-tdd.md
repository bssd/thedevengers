At a recent gathering of professionals interested in Agile the topic of Test Driven Development (TDD) cropped up. A number of the common misconceptions about TDD were brought up and it struck me how misunderstood the technique is. 

Two of the most common misconceptions are:

> We would practise TDD but we don't have any testers interested in writing code.

> Of course I do TDD, I always make sure I have covered off all the paths through my code before I finish.

The clue is in the name; Test **Driven Development**. 

TDD is a development activity performed by developers to write the code. They use the tests to drive development and the tests are written before the code and not after it.

The concept of TDD is relatively simple and can be summarised as:

1. For each new feature or behaviour write the test first. 
1. Run the test expecting it to fail.
1. Write just enough code to make the test pass.
1. Refactor the code to tidy up, remove duplication etc.

Sounds relatively straightforward doesn't it? There is more to it in practise and teams can find the learning curve too steep and give up before they see the benefits of it. 

Over the next few weeks and months we will publish more articles on exploring TDD starting with some of the benefits and drawbacks.
