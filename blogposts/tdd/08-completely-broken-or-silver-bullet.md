How is that for a click baiting title? Recently a few articles on TDD have been doing the rounds on twitter and appear very popular and generated a fair old amount of debate. 

First there was [this post](http://java.dzone.com/articles/programmers-without-tdd-will) predicting that by 2022 any developer not practising some form of TDD would be virtually unemployable. 

This week there was [an article](http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2014-01-25-the-failures-of-intro-to-tdd.html) about how the way we teach TDD is broken with a proposed remedy along with [Uncle Bobs response](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/01/27/TheChickenOrTheRoad.html). 

I don't want to discuss the first one too much, other than to say it is hyperbole to suggest that anyone not doing TDD won't be able to get a job. The article does a good job of promoting some of the misconceptions about what TDD is. Particularly when it comes to ignoring refactoring and the design aspects. 

I know enough good developers who don't see TDD as the answer to writing maintainable code that we will never have concensus across the industry as to whether it is the best way of developing software or not.  

The second article on teaching TDD raised some good points and highlighted some of the issues with the associated learning curve. However the conclusion about how we teach it being broken and the proposed solution did leave me nervous. 

I had been mulling it over for a day or so that the reason I feel comfortable practising TDD is that I have been using it and experimenting with it for so long. I have made a lot of the mistakes that you can make when practising TDD. I won't say I have made all the mistakes as I am sure I have more to learn. The important thing is that having to live with the consequence of my decisions and maintain a codebase over months and years means I appreciate why some things work better than others. 

Uncle Bob's post crystalised what I had been thinking. A lot of the way I practise TDD is inspired by [GOOS](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/) but not exactly like it as I have adapted it to a way that works for me. I think the same is true for the author of the post, they have found through experience a way of applying TDD that works for them. To be able to teach someone how to implement that particular flavour of TDD would be equally broken as it is based on years of experience and "knowing" when and how to apply it. 

I was going to go over the case of extracting functionality into new classes and methods outlined in the post but Uncle Bob covers it off better than I could and I would be going over the same ground. 

For me TDD isn't broken, it just takes time to learn to apply it properly and fully enjoy the benefits of it. Personally I find it the best way to deliver clean working maintainable software in the shortest possible time but I recognise that it is not for all people and never will be.
